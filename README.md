# github-contributors

  Basic Website that will require future developers to install jQuery, either
  through CDN or through npm install with a package.json.
  [gruntfile.js] optional but beneficial for testing and for linting.

  GitHub Contributors is a site that requires a github user Authentication token
  for validation to continue without any issues with githubs API. This site is
  designed to take in a query selector on Githubs API url(given) and it will spit out
  a random repository on GitHub with that specific query. After it will spit out
  a random commit on one of the random repos and give that commiters avatar and
  username. This information will be save on localStorage for future use until
  'cleared'.
